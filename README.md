# Bookstore API

A simple REST API for managing a bookstore — authors, books, and loans.

## Setup

### Requirements

- Docker and Docker Compose

### Getting Started

1. Clone the repository
2. Copy the environment file: `cp .env.example .env`
3. Start the containers: `docker-compose up -d --build` or `docker compose up -d --build`
4. Install dependencies: `docker exec -it bookstore_api composer install`
5. Generate app key: `docker exec -it bookstore_api php artisan key:generate`
6. Run migrations: `docker exec -it bookstore_api php artisan migrate`
7. Seed the database: `docker exec -it bookstore_api php artisan db:seed`
8. The API is available at `http://localhost:8080`

For any errors make sure the port is ```3306``` or ```3307```

### Running Tests

```bash
docker exec -it bookstore_api ./vendor/bin/phpunit
```

## Your Task

### 1. Refactor

The current code works but could be better structured. Improve the codebase — reorganize, extract, clean up — whatever you think makes it more maintainable.

The API endpoints should remain the same. We're interested in the choices you make and why.

### 2. Add Feature: Book Loans

Add the ability to borrow and return books:

- `POST /api/books/{uuid}/borrow` — Borrow a book (requires a `borrower` name)
- `POST /api/books/{uuid}/return` — Return a book

Rules:

- A book that is already borrowed cannot be borrowed again
- A book that is not borrowed cannot be returned
- The `GET /api/books/{uuid}` endpoint should show whether a book is available or borrowed, and who has it
- The `GET /api/books` endpoint should support an `available` filter (e.g., `?available=true`)
- Invalid operations should return appropriate HTTP status codes and clear error messages

How you model and structure this is up to you.

### 3. Tests

Write tests you think are meaningful for your changes. There is no minimum number — we want to see what you choose to test.

### Submission

Fork this repository, make your changes, and send us the link.

We care more about clean, thoughtful code than completeness. If you run out of time, a short note explaining what you'd do next is perfectly fine. If you have any questions, feel free to reach out.
